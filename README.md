Summary of Findings: Mortality Trends in America (1990-2019)

Our detailed analysis of mortality data in America from 1990 to 2019 provides crucial insights into the evolving health challenges and trends affecting the nation.
Key findings include:

Trend of Increasing Deaths: The data reveals a general trend of increasing total deaths over three decades, rising from 247,415,955 in 1990-1994 to 297,575,877 in 2015-2019. This upward trend highlights the growing healthcare needs of an aging population and underscores the importance of robust public health strategies.

Fluctuations in Death Rate Increases: The rate of increase in deaths fluctuated across the study periods. Notably, the smallest percentage increase occurred between 2005-2009 (approximately 2.20%), while the largest was observed between 2015-2019 (approximately 5.04%). This variability suggests shifts in mortality rates over time, with the most recent period showing a significant uptick in deaths.

Impact of COVID-19: The notable increase in deaths in the most recent period (2015-2019) coincides with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019. COVID-19 has likely contributed to the heightened mortality rate, marking a critical factor in the observed increase in deaths towards the end of our study period. This underscores the pandemic's significant impact on public health and mortality trends.

Dominant Causes of Death: Cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms (cancers) have consistently been the leading causes of death throughout the study period. While the number of deaths attributed to cardiovascular diseases appears to increase, age-adjusted data reveals an overall decreasing trend line, indicating progress in healthcare and prevention strategies. This nuanced finding highlights the complexity of interpreting mortality data against the backdrop of demographic changes and healthcare advancements.

Visualization and Public Health Implications: Our dashboard employs various visualization techniques, including stacked bar charts and treemaps, to illustrate these trends and provide insights into the changing health landscape. The persistence of cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms as primary causes of death, coupled with the recent surge in mortality likely influenced by COVID-19, emphasizes the need for continuous research, effective prevention measures, and accessible treatment options.

This analysis aims to inform policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the public about critical health trends and challenges facing America, fostering informed decision-making and effective health interventions to improve national health outcomes.
